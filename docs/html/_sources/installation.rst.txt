Installation
============

The Tidy3D client can be installed from PyPI:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install tidy3dclient

Once constructed, simulations can be run through the webapi that is included with the client.
The first time you use the webapi, you will be prompted to sign in.
If you don't yet have an account to use the Tidy3D solver, you can make or request one
